# Better Twitch Adblock


How does it work?

The extension works by finding an ad-free Twitch stream source.

Twitch Ads will be blocked for pre-rolls and mid-rolls and also on VOD's. We also block third party trackers.

No personal information is needed or collected. 

Any donations are very much welcome, as we do pay server costs to make this work.
