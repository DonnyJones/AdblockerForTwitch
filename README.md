# AdblockerForTwitch

How does it work?

The extension works by finding an ad-free stream source and replacing the ad with the ad-free version. The ad-free version will be limited to 480p, this is the best we can get. Once the ad is finished, the stream will automatically revert to the original video quality.

Ads will be blocked for pre-rolls and mid-rolls and also on VOD's. We also block third party trackers.

No personal information is needed or collected. 

Any donations are very much welcome, as we do pay server costs to make this work.
